        <p>
          I was born and raised in Stockholm, add some amazing roots from Chile.
       During most of my 20s I travelled and lived abroad, roaming the world calmly and tranquilly.<br><br>
       Love design in all areas and visiting so many beautiful countries with their handicrafts reflecting 
       the cultural traditions, made me come up with a business idea - textile and jewellery design. 
          <br><br>
      
      Finally settling down in my hometown and worked as a teacher for many years, introducing didactical 
      solutions for my students and loved how I could implement design, art and aestethics into the lessons. 
      <br><br>
        Times change and also did I. With a huge interest in the web development business and how 
        creative you can be, I decided to re-train myself to become a Frontend Developer.<br>
        And here I am, a Frontend Developer student. Don't hesitate to contact me.
